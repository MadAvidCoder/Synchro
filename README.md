# Synchro
### Play it [here](https://madavidcoder.github.io/Synchro)!
Synchro is a unique take on the classic Chrome No-Internet Game. In this version a pirate must jump over sharks, and avoid flying seagulls. You can also collect coins, to get extra points.

But Synchro has a twist that will put your multitasking skills to the test - you must control two characters at once.

To make the top pirate jump, press W. To make the bottom jump, press the down arrow. Activate powerups along the way to make it as far as possible.
